Once the TallyUp reaches 25,000 we can be pretty confident weâ€™ve got something that will fly. 

In this stage we will create a basic donations platform where members can contribute monthly micro-donations which will be capped at *$TBC*. 

Donations will be used to start establishing basic systems and processes etc. 

The Start-up stage runs until the TallyUp reaches 50,000.

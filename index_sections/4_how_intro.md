Getting **political.nz** off the ground will happen in stages. The stages are measured by the TallyUp™. The TallyUp is the heartbeat of **political.nz**. The TallyUp is the way members check-in each month to confirm support for the project. We think of it as a micro-donation of will-power.

On the last day of each month, we send an email notification of the TallyUp count for that month. Participants simply hit **‘reply’** then **‘send’** to confirm support and to be counted in the next TallyUp and so on. 

You can see the current TallyUp live at the top of this page. You can make that number go up by joining the TallyUp.
 
As support for the project grows so too will interest and connections, providing a greater collective resource pool. This allows us to boot-strap the project without a huge organisation and big donors. With that said there is still a huge amount of work to even reach the first stage. 

Expand the following sections to learn about the proposed stages. These still need to be revised and stages beyond *Vision* are a rough guess at the moment.

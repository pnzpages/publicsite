Politics is a dirty word, but what if we could change that?

**political.nz** is a project to re-invent the political party and the way we do politics. 

**political.nz** is building a new kind of political party which operates within the existing political landscape alongside traditional parties.

**political.nz** transcends left/right ideology and aims to bring together people with different views to find common ground and collectively build policy.

Unlike traditional parties which seek power to promote the agenda of the party elite, **political.nz** exists purely to empower everyday people with a real voice in shaping the direction of our amazing country. To achieve this, we’re developing the processes and technology to make participating in politics, easy, accessible, and meaningful. The infographic below shows some of our early thinking as to how this could work.

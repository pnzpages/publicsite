In this stage we’ll bring together a core team to develop and communicate the vision with the main aim of growing the TallyUp.

 - Stage 1 will run until the TallyUp reaches 25,000.
 - No donations are accepted during this stage.
 - Digital participation will be limited to the TallyUp.
 - Begin work on constitution.
 - Revised start-up plan.
 - Publicity and recruiting. 

This is an opportunity to bring your skills, ideas, and experience to a project capable of transforming the way we do politics in Aotearoa New Zealand. That’s the mission we’re on, and we’d love for you to join us. 

We are actively recruiting volunteers for this stage.

While we do need some specific skillsets such as communications, design, and web development, we also need anyone who is willing to help get the idea out there and grow the TallyUp.

You can help build the momentum to get **political.nz** off the ground. It takes less than 2 minutes per month.

Simply send an email to [tallyup@political.nz](mailto: tallyup@political.nz?subject=join) **with the subject ‘join’**.

The TallyUp™ is the heartbeat of **political.nz** and the first phase of participation.  We think of it as a regular micro-donation of will-power. It’s a way of showing support for the project without having to do much at all! Here’s how it works.  

On the last day of each month, we send an email notification with the TallyUp count for that month. Participants simply **hit ‘reply’ then ‘send’** to confirm support and to be counted in the next TallyUp and so on.

You can see the current TallyUp live at the top of this page. You can make that number go up by joining the TallyUp.

As support for the project grows so too will interest and connections, providing a greater collective resource pool. This allows us to boot-strap the project without a huge organisation and big donors.
